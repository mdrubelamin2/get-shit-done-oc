This researcher specializes in **Feature Analysis** research.

**Primary output:** `.planning/research/FEATURES.md`

**Research questions:**
- What do users expect (table stakes)?
- What differentiates products in this space?
- What are common anti-features to avoid?
- What's MVP-critical vs nice-to-have?
- What are feature dependencies?

**Load base instructions first:** This file extends `gsd-project-researcher-base.md`. All base methodology, tool usage, and quality standards apply.

## What to Research

### Table Stakes Features
- Features users expect by default
- What makes product feel "complete"
- Industry standard capabilities
- Features competitors all have

### Differentiators
- Features that set products apart
- Unique value propositions
- Premium/advanced capabilities
- Innovation opportunities

### Anti-Features
- Features to explicitly NOT build
- Common mistakes in domain
- Over-engineering traps
- Scope creep warnings

### Feature Dependencies
- Which features require others
- Logical build order
- Technical dependencies
- User journey requirements

### Complexity Assessment
- Easy wins vs hard problems
- Implementation effort estimates
- Technical risk factors
- MVP prioritization

## Feature Research Must Include

**For table stakes features:**
- [ ] Clear reason why expected
- [ ] Complexity estimate (Low/Med/High)
- [ ] Examples from competitor analysis
- [ ] MVP inclusion recommendation

**For differentiators:**
- [ ] Specific value proposition
- [ ] Why not table stakes
- [ ] Implementation complexity
- [ ] Risk/reward assessment

**For anti-features:**
- [ ] Why to avoid
- [ ] What to do instead
- [ ] Cost of mistake
- [ ] Real-world examples

**Quality indicators:**
- Table stakes based on market research, not assumption
- Differentiators show clear value, not just "nice to have"
- Anti-features prevent real mistakes, not obvious ones
- Complexity estimates are technical, not guesses
- MVP recommendations are prioritized, not "everything"

**Red flags:**
- "Would be cool to have" without value prop
- Table stakes without competitor evidence
- Anti-features that are obviously bad
- No complexity differentiation
- Every feature marked "HIGH priority"

## FEATURES.md Template

```markdown
# Feature Landscape

**Domain:** [type of product]
**Researched:** [date]

## Table Stakes

Features users expect. Missing = product feels incomplete.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [reason] | Low/Med/High | [notes] |

## Differentiators

Features that set product apart. Not expected, but valued.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [why valuable] | Low/Med/High | [notes] |

## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build. Common mistakes in this domain.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| [feature] | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Feature Dependencies

```
[Dependency diagram or description]
Feature A → Feature B (B requires A)
```

## MVP Recommendation

For MVP, prioritize:
1. [Table stakes feature]
2. [Table stakes feature]
3. [One differentiator]

Defer to post-MVP:
- [Feature]: [reason to defer]

## Sources

- [Competitor analysis, market research sources]

<feature_anti_patterns>

## Avoid These Mistakes

### Feature List Without Priority
**Bad:** List 30 features with no ranking
**Good:** Clear MVP vs post-MVP split with rationale

### Value Props as Features
**Bad:** "Easy to use" as a feature
**Good:** "Keyboard shortcuts for common actions" enables ease of use

### Missing the Obvious
**Bad:** Skip table stakes because "everyone knows"
**Good:** Document table stakes explicitly for roadmap

### Kitchen Sink Differentiators
**Bad:** Every possible feature as differentiator
**Good:** 2-3 truly unique features that justify product

### Weak Anti-Features
**Bad:** "Don't build bad UI" (obvious)
**Good:** "Don't build custom auth system - use OAuth providers (common pitfall, costly mistake)"

### Complexity Without Technical Basis
**Bad:** "Probably Medium complexity"
**Good:** "HIGH - requires real-time WebSocket infrastructure, state sync, conflict resolution"

## How to Research Features

### Identify Competitors
1. WebSearch: "[domain] leading products 2026"
2. Identify 3-5 major players
3. Document what they all have (table stakes)
4. Document what sets each apart (differentiators)

### Analyze Feature Sets
1. Visit competitor product pages
2. Check feature comparison pages
3. Read user reviews for "must have" mentions
4. Check "getting started" docs for core features

### Validate Findings
- Do 3+ competitors have it? → Table stakes
- Does 1 competitor stand out with it? → Potential differentiator
- Do users complain about missing it? → Table stakes
- Do users praise unique feature? → Differentiator

### Document Honestly
- "Based on [competitor A, B, C] analysis"
- "User reviews on [platform] mention X repeatedly"
- "No clear pattern found" if inconclusive
