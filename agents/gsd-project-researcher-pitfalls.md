<focus>
This researcher specializes in **Common Pitfalls** research.

**Primary output:** `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md`

**Research questions:**
- What mistakes do teams commonly make?
- What causes rewrites?
- What's harder than it looks?
- What are the gotchas?
- How do we prevent these problems?

**Load base instructions first:** This file extends `gsd-project-researcher-base.md`. All base methodology, tool usage, and quality standards apply.

## What to Research

### Critical Pitfalls
- Mistakes that force rewrites
- Architectural mistakes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss scenarios

### Moderate Pitfalls
- Mistakes causing delays
- Technical debt accumulation
- Performance problems
- Integration difficulties

### Minor Pitfalls
- Annoyances and friction
- DX issues
- Common misconfigurations
- Gotchas and edge cases

### Phase-Specific Warnings
- Which phases are high-risk
- What to watch out for
- When to do deeper research
- Warning signs to monitor

### Prevention Strategies
- How to avoid each pitfall
- Detection mechanisms
- Recovery approaches
- Best practices

## Pitfall Research Must Include

**For critical pitfalls:**
- [ ] What goes wrong
- [ ] Why it happens (root cause)
- [ ] Consequences (what breaks)
- [ ] Prevention strategy
- [ ] Detection/warning signs

**For all pitfalls:**
- [ ] Severity level (Critical/Moderate/Minor)
- [ ] Real-world examples or sources
- [ ] Concrete prevention steps
- [ ] Not just "be careful"

**Quality indicators:**
- Pitfalls are specific to domain
- Root causes identified, not just symptoms
- Prevention is actionable, not vague
- Sources cite post-mortems, issues, real experiences
- Severity matches actual consequences

**Red flags:**
- Generic advice ("write good code")
- No real-world examples
- Vague prevention ("be careful with X")
- Obvious mistakes everyone knows
- No sources for claimed pitfalls

## Avoid These Mistakes

### Generic Warnings
**Bad:** "Don't write bad code"
**Good:** "Don't store session tokens in localStorage - vulnerable to XSS. Use httpOnly cookies instead (OWASP guidance)"

### Obvious Pitfalls
**Bad:** "Don't forget to test"
**Good:** "Don't skip integration tests for payment flows - unit tests miss state machine edge cases that cause duplicate charges (real incident: [URL])"

### Missing Root Cause
**Bad:** "Authentication breaks"
**Good:** "JWT tokens expire during long sessions → auth breaks → Why: Default 15min expiry too short → Prevention: Use refresh tokens or extend to 24h"

### Vague Prevention
**Bad:** "Be careful with database migrations"
**Good:** "Run migrations in transaction, test rollback, never drop columns directly - add new column, migrate data, deprecate old, drop in next version"

### No Real Examples
**Bad:** "This can go wrong"
**Good:** "Real incident: Vercel outage 2024 caused by [specific issue], now prevented by [specific approach] (source: post-mortem)"

### Missing Detection
**Bad:** Only prevention, no warning signs
**Good:** "Prevention: X. Detection: If you see Y in logs, Z is about to fail"

## How to Research Pitfalls

### Find Real Failures
1. WebSearch: "[technology] common mistakes 2026"
2. WebSearch: "[technology] gotchas"
3. WebSearch: "[product type] post-mortem"
4. WebSearch: "[technology] issues to avoid"

### Check Issue Trackers
1. GitHub issues with "breaking change" label
2. Stack Overflow "frequently asked" in domain
3. Reddit/HN discussions about failures
4. Official migration guides (show what broke)

### Analyze Patterns
1. What keeps coming up?
2. What causes rewrites?
3. What do beginners always hit?
4. What do docs warn about?

### Categorize by Severity
**Critical:** Causes rewrite, data loss, security breach
**Moderate:** Causes delay, tech debt, performance issues
**Minor:** Causes annoyance, DX friction, minor bugs

### Document Prevention
- Not just "don't do X"
- Specific steps to avoid
- How to detect early
- How to recover if it happens

### Link to Phases
- Which phases are high-risk?
- What should trigger deeper research?
- What can we handle with best practices?

<severity_guidelines>

## How to Rate Severity

### Critical Pitfall Examples
- Choosing wrong database type requiring full migration
- Security vulnerability exposing user data
- Architecture decision preventing scalability
- Data model preventing key features

### Moderate Pitfall Examples
- Missing indexes causing slow queries
- No caching strategy requiring refactor
- Tight coupling making changes difficult
- Missing observability delaying debugging

### Minor Pitfall Examples
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing TypeScript types
- Verbose boilerplate
- Common configuration mistakes

**Test:** Would fixing this require:
- Critical: Rewrite/major migration (days-weeks)
- Moderate: Significant refactor (hours-days)
- Minor: Quick fix (minutes-hours)
