This file provides detailed examples and patterns for gsd-planner agents.

**Core planning protocol is in:** @agents/gsd-planner-core.md

Use this file for:
- Task specificity examples
- Dependency patterns
- Depth calibration guidance
- Goal-backward failure examples

## Specificity Examples

Tasks must be specific enough for clean execution. Compare:

| TOO VAGUE | JUST RIGHT |
|-----------|------------|
| "Add authentication" | "Add JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library, store in httpOnly cookie, 15min access / 7day refresh" |
| "Create the API" | "Create POST /api/projects endpoint accepting {name, description}, validates name length 3-50 chars, returns 201 with project object" |
| "Style the dashboard" | "Add Tailwind classes to Dashboard.tsx: grid layout (3 cols on lg, 1 on mobile), card shadows, hover states on action buttons" |
| "Handle errors" | "Wrap API calls in try/catch, return {error: string} on 4xx/5xx, show toast via sonner on client" |
| "Set up the database" | "Add User and Project models to schema.prisma with UUID ids, email unique constraint, createdAt/updatedAt timestamps, run prisma db push" |

**The test:** Could a different Claude instance execute this task without asking clarifying questions? If not, add specificity.

## TDD Detection Heuristic

For each potential task, evaluate TDD fit:

**Heuristic:** Can you write `expect(fn(input)).toBe(output)` before writing `fn`?
- Yes: Create a dedicated TDD plan for this feature
- No: Standard task in standard plan

**TDD candidates (create dedicated TDD plans):**
- Business logic with defined inputs/outputs
- API endpoints with request/response contracts
- Data transformations, parsing, formatting
- Validation rules and constraints
- Algorithms with testable behavior
- State machines and workflows

**Standard tasks (remain in standard plans):**
- UI layout, styling, visual components
- Configuration changes
- Glue code connecting existing components
- One-off scripts and migrations
- Simple CRUD with no business logic

**Why TDD gets its own plan:** TDD requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR), consuming 40-50% context for a single feature. Embedding in multi-task plans degrades quality.

## User Setup Detection

For tasks involving external services, identify human-required configuration:

External service indicators:
- New SDK: `stripe`, `@sendgrid/mail`, `twilio`, `openai`, `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Webhook handlers: Files in `**/webhooks/**`
- OAuth integration: Social login, third-party auth
- API keys: Code referencing `process.env.SERVICE_*` patterns

For each external service, determine:
1. **Env vars needed** - What secrets must be retrieved from dashboards?
2. **Account setup** - Does user need to create an account?
3. **Dashboard config** - What must be configured in external UI?

Record in `user_setup` frontmatter. Only include what Claude literally cannot do (account creation, secret retrieval, dashboard config).

**Important:** User setup info goes in frontmatter ONLY. Do NOT surface it in your planning output or show setup tables to users. The execute-plan workflow handles presenting this at the right time (after automation completes).

## Vertical Slices vs Horizontal Layers

**Vertical slices (PREFER):**
```
Plan 01: User feature (model + API + UI)
Plan 02: Product feature (model + API + UI)
Plan 03: Order feature (model + API + UI)
```
Result: All three can run in parallel (Wave 1)

**Horizontal layers (AVOID):**
```
Plan 01: Create User model, Product model, Order model
Plan 02: Create User API, Product API, Order API
Plan 03: Create User UI, Product UI, Order UI
```
Result: Fully sequential (02 needs 01, 03 needs 02)

**When vertical slices work:**
- Features are independent (no shared types/data)
- Each slice is self-contained
- No cross-feature dependencies

**When horizontal layers are necessary:**
- Shared foundation required (auth before protected features)
- Genuine type dependencies (Order needs User type)
- Infrastructure setup (database before all features)

<depth_calibration>

## Depth Calibration

Depth controls compression tolerance, not artificial inflation.

| Depth | Typical Plans/Phase | Tasks/Plan |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Quick | 1-3 | 2-3 |
| Standard | 3-5 | 2-3 |
| Comprehensive | 5-10 | 2-3 |

**Key principle:** Derive plans from actual work. Depth determines how aggressively you combine things, not a target to hit.

- Comprehensive auth phase = 8 plans (because auth genuinely has 8 concerns)
- Comprehensive "add config file" phase = 1 plan (because that's all it is)

Don't pad small work to hit a number. Don't compress complex work to look efficient.

## Common Failures

**Truths too vague:**
- Bad: "User can use chat"
- Good: "User can see messages", "User can send message", "Messages persist"

**Artifacts too abstract:**
- Bad: "Chat system", "Auth module"
- Good: "src/components/Chat.tsx", "src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts"

**Missing wiring:**
- Bad: Listing components without how they connect
- Good: "Chat.tsx fetches from /api/chat via useEffect on mount"
