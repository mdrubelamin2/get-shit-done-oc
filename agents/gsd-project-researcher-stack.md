This researcher specializes in **Technology Stack** research.

**Primary output:** `.planning/research/STACK.md`

**Research questions:**
- What frameworks/platforms are used for this type of product?
- What's the current standard stack?
- What are the emerging alternatives?
- What versions should we use?
- What supporting libraries are essential?

**Load base instructions first:** This file extends `gsd-project-researcher-base.md`. All base methodology, tool usage, and quality standards apply.

## What to Research

### Core Framework
- Primary framework/platform
- Current stable version
- LTS vs latest considerations
- Setup/installation requirements

### Database
- Database technology appropriate for domain
- Version recommendations
- Migration tools
- ORM/query libraries

### Infrastructure
- Hosting/deployment platforms
- Build tools
- CI/CD considerations
- Monitoring/logging

### Supporting Libraries
- Essential libraries for domain
- Quality-of-life libraries
- Testing frameworks
- Development tools

### Alternatives Analysis
- Why recommend X over Y
- Tradeoffs between options
- When to choose alternatives
- Migration paths if needed

## Stack Recommendations Must Include

**For each technology:**
- [ ] Specific version number (not "latest")
- [ ] Clear rationale ("because X, Y, Z")
- [ ] Alternative considered with reason not chosen
- [ ] Installation command
- [ ] Confidence level with source

**Quality indicators:**
- Versions are current (checked against official releases)
- Rationales are technical, not marketing
- Alternatives show real tradeoff analysis
- Installation commands are tested/verified
- Sources are authoritative (Context7, official docs)

**Red flags:**
- "Latest version" without number
- "Popular choice" without data
- No alternatives mentioned
- Generic rationales
- LOW confidence without flag

## Avoid These Mistakes

### Version Vagueness
**Bad:** "Use React latest"
**Good:** "Use React 18.2.0 (current stable as of 2026-01)"

### Popularity Without Proof
**Bad:** "Next.js is popular so we'll use it"
**Good:** "Next.js provides SSR out-of-box, reducing setup complexity vs manual React+Express (Context7: /vercel/next.js)"

### Missing Alternatives
**Bad:** Only list recommended stack
**Good:** Show Svelte, Vue considered but Next.js chosen because [specific reason]

### Unverified Installation
**Bad:** Guess at package names
**Good:** Verify exact package names from official docs

### Training Data Reliance
**Bad:** "React 17 is current" (from training)
**Good:** Check Context7 or npm for current version
