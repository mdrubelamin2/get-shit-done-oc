<purpose>
Orchestrate parallel codebase mapper agents to analyze codebase and produce structured documents in .planning/codebase/

Each agent has fresh context, explores a specific focus area, and **writes documents directly**. The orchestrator only receives confirmation + line counts, then writes a summary.

Output: .planning/codebase/ folder with 7 structured documents about the codebase state.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Why dedicated mapper agents:**
- Fresh context per domain (no token contamination)
- Agents write documents directly (no context transfer back to orchestrator)
- Orchestrator only summarizes what was created (minimal context usage)
- Faster execution (agents run simultaneously)

**Document quality over length:**
Include enough detail to be useful as reference. Prioritize practical examples (especially code patterns) over arbitrary brevity.

**Always include file paths:**
Documents are reference material for Antigravity when planning/executing. Always include actual file paths formatted with backticks: `src/services/user.ts`.
</philosophy>

<process>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Context:** You are operating in the user's PROJECT DIRECTORY.
> **CRITICAL:** Execute all commands (ls, cat, mkdir) in the current working directory. DO NOT cd into the workflow source directories.


<step name="resolve_model_profile" priority="first">
Read model profile for agent spawning:

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"model_profile"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

## Mapping Complete

**Focus:** {focus}
**Documents written:**
- `.planning/codebase/{DOC1}.md` ({N} lines)
- `.planning/codebase/{DOC2}.md` ({N} lines)

Ready for orchestrator summary.
```

**What you receive:** Just file paths and line counts. NOT document contents.

If any agent failed, note the failure and continue with successful documents.

Continue to verify_output.
</step>

<step name="verify_output">
Verify all documents created successfully:

```bash
ls -la .planning/codebase/
wc -l .planning/codebase/*.md
```

**Verification checklist:**
- All 7 documents exist
- No empty documents (each should have >20 lines)

If any documents missing or empty, note which agents may have failed.

Continue to commit_codebase_map.
</step>

<step name="commit_codebase_map">
Commit the codebase map:

**Check planning config:**

```bash
COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=$(cat .planning/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"commit_docs"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "true")
git check-ignore -q .planning 2>/dev/null && COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false
```

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false`:** Skip git operations

**If `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=true` (default):**

```bash
git add .planning/codebase/*.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: map existing codebase

- STACK.md - Technologies and dependencies
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design and patterns
- STRUCTURE.md - Directory layout
- CONVENTIONS.md - Code style and patterns

EOF
)"
```

Continue to offer_next.
</step>

<step name="offer_next">
Present completion summary and next steps.

**Get line counts:**
```bash
wc -l .planning/codebase/*.md
```

**Output format:**

```
Codebase mapping complete.

Created .planning/codebase/:
- STACK.md ([N] lines) - Technologies and dependencies
- ARCHITECTURE.md ([N] lines) - System design and patterns
- STRUCTURE.md ([N] lines) - Directory layout and organization
- CONVENTIONS.md ([N] lines) - Code style and patterns
- TESTING.md ([N] lines) - Test structure and practices

## ▶ Next Up

**Initialize project** — use codebase context for planning

`/gsd:new-project`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- Re-run mapping: `/gsd:map-codebase`
- Review specific file: `cat .planning/codebase/STACK.md`
- Edit any document before proceeding

---
```

End workflow.
