description: Initialize a new project with deep context gathering and PROJECT.md
---


<objective>

Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

This is the most leveraged moment in any project. Deep questioning here means better plans, better execution, better outcomes. One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning.

**Creates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — project context
- `.planning/config.json` — workflow preferences
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure
- `.planning/STATE.md` — project memory

**After this command:** Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to start execution.

</objective>

<execution_context>

.agent/resources/references/questioning.md
.agent/resources/references/ui-brand.md
.agent/resources/templates/project.md
.agent/resources/templates/requirements.md

</execution_context>

<process>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Context:** You are operating in the user's PROJECT DIRECTORY.
> **CRITICAL:** Execute all commands (ls, cat, mkdir) in the current working directory. DO NOT cd into the workflow source directories.


## Phase 1: Setup

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP — Execute these checks before ANY user interaction:**

1. **Abort if project exists:**
   ```bash
   [ -f .planning/PROJECT.md ] && echo "ERROR: Project already initialized. Use /gsd:progress" && exit 1
   ```

2. **Initialize git repo in THIS directory** (required even if inside a parent repo):
   ```bash
   if [ -d .git ] || [ -f .git ]; then
       echo "Git repo exists in current directory"
   else
       git init
       echo "Initialized new git repo"
   fi
   ```

3. **Detect existing code (brownfield detection):**
   ```bash
   CODE_FILES=$(find . -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.swift" -o -name "*.java" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | head -20)
   HAS_PACKAGE=$([ -f package.json ] || [ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f Cargo.toml ] || [ -f go.mod ] || [ -f Package.swift ] && echo "yes")
   HAS_CODEBASE_MAP=$([ -d .planning/codebase ] && echo "yes")
   ```

   **You MUST run all bash commands above using the Bash tool before proceeding.**

## Phase 2: Brownfield Offer

**If existing code detected and .planning/codebase/ doesn't exist:**

Check the results from setup step:
- If `CODE_FILES` is non-empty OR `HAS_PACKAGE` is "yes"
- AND `HAS_CODEBASE_MAP` is NOT "yes"

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Existing Code"
- question: "I detected existing code in this directory. Would you like to map the codebase first?"
- options:
  - "Map codebase first" — Run /gsd:map-codebase to understand existing architecture (Recommended)
  - "Skip mapping" — Proceed with project initialization

**If "Map codebase first":**
```
Run `/gsd:map-codebase` first, then return to `/gsd:new-project`
```
Exit command.

**If "Skip mapping":** Continue to Phase 3.

**If no existing code detected OR codebase already mapped:** Continue to Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Deep Questioning

**Display stage banner:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► QUESTIONING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Open the conversation:**

Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion):

"What do you want to build?"

Wait for their response. This gives you the context needed to ask intelligent follow-up questions.

**Follow the thread:**

Based on what they said, ask follow-up questions that dig into their response. Use AskUserQuestion with options that probe what they mentioned — interpretations, clarifications, concrete examples.

Keep following threads. Each answer opens new threads to explore. Ask about:
- What excited them
- What problem sparked this
- What they mean by vague terms
- What it would actually look like
- What's already decided

Consult `questioning.md` for techniques:
- Challenge vagueness
- Make abstract concrete
- Surface assumptions
- Find edges
- Reveal motivation

**Check context (background, not out loud):**

As you go, mentally check the context checklist from `questioning.md`. If gaps remain, weave questions naturally. Don't suddenly switch to checklist mode.

**Decision gate:**

When you could write a clear PROJECT.md, use AskUserQuestion:

- header: "Ready?"
- question: "I think I understand what you're after. Ready to create PROJECT.md?"
- options:
  - "Create PROJECT.md" — Let's move forward
  - "Keep exploring" — I want to share more / ask me more

If "Keep exploring" — ask what they want to add, or identify gaps and probe naturally.

Loop until "Create PROJECT.md" selected.

## Phase 4: Write PROJECT.md

Synthesize all context into `.planning/PROJECT.md` using the template from `templates/project.md`.

**For greenfield projects:**

Initialize requirements as hypotheses:

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] [Requirement 1]
- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
- [Exclusion 2] — [why]
```

All Active requirements are hypotheses until shipped and validated.

**For brownfield projects (codebase map exists):**

Infer Validated requirements from existing code:

1. Read `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STACK.md`
2. Identify what the codebase already does
3. These become the initial Validated set

```markdown
## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ [Existing capability 1] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 2] — existing
- ✓ [Existing capability 3] — existing

### Active

- [ ] [New requirement 1]
- [ ] [New requirement 2]

### Out of Scope

- [Exclusion 1] — [why]
```

**Key Decisions:**

Initialize with any decisions made during questioning:

```markdown
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Choice from questioning] | [Why] | — Pending |
```

**Last updated footer:**

```markdown
---
*Last updated: [date] after initialization*
```

Do not compress. Capture everything gathered.

**Commit PROJECT.md:**

```bash
mkdir -p .planning
git add .planning/PROJECT.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
docs: initialize project

[One-liner from PROJECT.md What This Is section]
EOF
)"
```
## Phase 5: Workflow Preferences

**To continue this phase:**
```
@gsd:new-project-phase-5.md
```

After completing Phase 5, return here to proceed.

## Phase 5.5: Resolve Model Profile

> [!NOTE]

After completing Phase 5.5, return here to proceed.

## Phase 6: Research Decision

> [!NOTE]
> This phase has been extracted to a separate workflow for size management.

**To continue this phase:**
```
@gsd:new-project-phase-6.md
```

After completing Phase 6, return here to proceed.

## Phase 10: Done
